# Wheatley Companion Robot

This project is a beginner-friendly robotics project inspired by the character Wheatley from *Portal 2*. The goal is to build a simple, interactive robot that features moving eyes, an LED light to simulate Wheatley's "eye glow," and basic proximity detection to respond to nearby objects or people.

### Features:
- **Eye Movement**: Controlled by two servo motors for horizontal and vertical movement.
- **LED Eye**: A glowing LED to mimic Wheatley's expressive eye.
- **Proximity Detection**: An ultrasonic sensor that triggers eye movement and LED feedback when an object is detected.
- **Arduino-Controlled**: The project uses an Arduino microcontroller to handle the robot's movements and interactions.

This project is a fun way to learn about basic robotics, sensors, and servo motor control, and can be expanded with additional features like sound effects or more complex movement.
